Demo outline:
    1. End-to-end demo:
        * start a bunch of clients and a tracker cluster
        * give all clients but one a file
        * get the file on the last client
        * possibly log to show where chunks are coming from
    2. Demonstrate test/failure handing:
        * Demonstrate tracker failure/recovery
        * Demonstrate local file removal
        * Demonstrate malicious node handling
    3. Discuss design:
        * Name-by-hash
        * Hashing to check chunk validity
        * Clients may go on/off-line as they please - other clients will not report them
        * RPC
        * Paxos details: 
            - Exponential backoff for dueling leaders
            - Establish cluster with master-slave strategy (from storage server)
            - During Paxos, if a node is out-of-date, it will ping other nodes to catch-up
            - Two main goroutines:
                + eventHandler
                    * Receives / deals with RPCs
                + paxosHandler
                    * maintains a list of pending ops
                    * broadcasts the prepare/accept/commit messages
